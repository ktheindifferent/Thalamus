# Project Description

## Thalamus - Deep Learning Mesh Node Server Platform

### Project Summary
Thalamus is a distributed deep learning server platform written in Rust that provides various AI/ML services through a web API and P2P mesh networking capabilities. The project aims to create a decentralized network of nodes that can handle various AI tasks including speech-to-text, text-to-speech, language models, and image processing.

### Current Work Status

#### Completed Features
- Basic project structure with Rust/Cargo setup
- Web server implementation using Rouille
- P2P networking foundation with libp2p
- mDNS service discovery for node detection
- Initial module structure for various AI services

#### Work in Progress
- Whisper.cpp integration for Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Llama.cpp integration for GPT chat generation (multiple model support: 7B, 13B, 30B, 65B)
- OpenTTS support for Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- YOLOv8 image recognition
- Neural Style Transfer (NST)
- Super Resolution using SRGAN
- Job queue system for distributed task management
- Capability framework for nodes

#### Architecture Components
1. **Main Server** (`src/main.rs`): Core server with HTTP API and P2P networking
2. **P2P Module** (`src/p2p.rs`): Peer-to-peer mesh networking implementation
3. **Thalamus Module** (`src/thalamus.rs`): Core business logic
4. **Services**:
   - Image processing (YOLO, NST, SRGAN, OCNN)
   - Language models (Llama)
   - Speech services (Whisper, TTS)
5. **Tools**: Network utilities (CIDR, network scanning)

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Rust (Edition 2021)
- **Web Framework**: Rouille
- **P2P Networking**: libp2p
- **Service Discovery**: mDNS/DNS-SD
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch (via tch), TensorFlow (via tract)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio

### Recent Development Activity
- Setting up project documentation structure
- Reviewing codebase for partially implemented features
- Identifying areas needing test coverage
- Planning implementation of pending features from TODO list
- Fixed dependency issues (wasm-bindgen, time crate updates)
- Added initial test suite with 8 unit tests for core structures
- Created comprehensive documentation (overview.md, todo.md, project_description.md)

### Work Completed Today
1. Updated dependencies to fix compilation errors:
   - Updated wasm-bindgen from 0.2.86 to 0.2.100
   - Updated time crate from 0.3.21 to 0.3.41
2. Created basic test structure in src/lib.rs with tests for:
   - ThalamusClient initialization
   - ThalamusNode creation
   - ThalamusJob management
   - ThalamusNodeStats
   - VersionReply and STTReply structures
   - Args command-line arguments structure
3. Made PyTorch dependency optional:
   - Added feature flags in Cargo.toml (pytorch, full)
   - Made tch crate optional
   - Added conditional compilation for NST module
   - Project can now build without PyTorch/libtorch installed

### Next Steps
- Complete build process and verify all tests pass
- Review and improve partially implemented job system
- Add comprehensive tests for p2p module
- Add integration tests for HTTP API endpoints
- Complete integration of AI service modules
- Finalize job queue system
- Complete capability framework for node discovery
- Add encryption support for secure communication
